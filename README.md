# WneWs
A news website which shows news from various sources according to your interest.
This is my final year project, and I built it with the help of CodeWithHarry's YouTube channel.

WnEWS is a modern news website built using React.js, designed to bring all the latest news from multiple sources into one platform. It provides a seamless reading experience with real-time updates, category-based filtering, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
